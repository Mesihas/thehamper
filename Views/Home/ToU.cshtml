Linking policy

Linked websites
We take reasonable care in linking MyHamper.com to other websites but we have no direct control over the content presented in those websites or the availability of those websites. Any information on a linked website is provided 'As Is'.
We make no representation that the material on any linked websites does not infringe the intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person. We do not authorise the reproduction of such material.
We do not endorse or recommend any links to external websites, or third party content, including products and services offered by, from or through those websites or their content.
We use the following criteria to select the links that are included on this site:
The content must be authentic. MyHamper.com will primarily link to government content or websites known to be sponsored by The Hamper NEtwork. Every effort is made to ensure the links are as current and as complete as possible, 
however due to the consistent process of change on government websites there will inevitably be a small amount of out-of-date or missing content at any point of time.
The content should be up-to-date and accurate. Links will be made in good faith with the expectation that the content is appropriately maintained by the author and is timely and accurate. However, we can offer no guarantees of this.
Please note that there are exceptions. Due to the nature of Australian Stories, their content may include links to a variety of Australian, state, territory and local government cultural agencies as well as to commercial websites and organisations.
Australian Government agencies can inform MyHamper.com of new sites or pages for inclusion in the MyHamper.com using the contact us form.

imply that the Australian Government endorses your website or product
use MyHamper.com solely for commercial practices
change the content of the material technically (eg the material is presented in a frame so that users are unable to determine the location of the original material).
We may ask you to remove the link from your website if these conditions are not met.
